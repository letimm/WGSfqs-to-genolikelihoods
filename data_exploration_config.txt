DATA EXPLORATION CONFIG FILE
#A general note: 
	#number of minQ_vals * number of minMapQ_vals * (1 or 2 if check_transitions is "no" or "yes", respectively) = number of scripts written
#working_directory specifies where scripts, results, and jobout files will be written
#reference_genome requires the full path to the reference genome fasta (uncompressed); 
	#samtools faidx will have run over this genome in step0 of the lcWGSpipeline, 
	#but if data_exploration is run outside of the pipeline, 
	#samtools faidx must be run manually (it's very fast).
	#If the user has access to an ancestral genome, specify the path to it with this setting.
#data_exploration_prefix is the prefix for the run; this is optional - if no prefix is given, the script will default to "de".
	#The prefix does not need to recapitulate the details of the run - filenames will reflect parameter settings.
#endedness takes "SE" for single-end and "PE" for paired-end
#foldedness takes "folded" (if the ancestral genome is the reference genome, which is the usual case) or 
	#"unfolded" (if an ancestral genome is provided to ref_genome).
#both minQ_vals and minMapQ_vals can take as many comma-separated values as the user chooses to pass, from 1-?. 
	#However, if >4 scripts will be written (generating >5 datasets of heterozygosity), the script will ask for confirmaiton before continuing.
#both min_depth and max_depth take a single value
#check_transitions can be set to 
	#"yes", which will run -noTrans 0 (allow transitions) and -noTrans 1 (disallow transitions); or 
	#"no", which will always allow transitions.
#bamslist_file is the file providing a list of bamfiles to use for data exploration
	#(complete paths must be provided to the bamslist_file and within the file to every bamfile)
#email takes the email address to which failed jobs alerts should be sent
